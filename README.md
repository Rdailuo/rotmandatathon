# Rotman Datathon 2025: Making Supply Chains More Resilient

January 16th, 2025

Key findings suggest that broad money and government debt contribute significantly to inflation, while strong export sectors help stabilize costs.

The report offers three main recommendations: relocating supply chains to tax-efficient regions, implementing risk-pooling agreements with suppliers, and investing in workforce development to improve stability. These strategies aim to help businesses mitigate the impact of rising costs and build more resilient supply chains.

Analyzing the Impact of Rising Cost of Living Relative to Economic Development and Supply Chain Dynamics
1. Overview
In recent years, the rising cost of living has significantly impacted households, businesses, and entire economies. As living expenses grow faster than income in many regions, the strain on consumer spending extends into broader economic effects, influencing everything from purchasing behavior to supply chain stability. Rising costs put particular pressure on supply chains, as businesses struggle to manage production costs, transport, and labor prices, which then impact product availability and affordability for consumers.

For this iteration of Rotman Datathon 2025, participants will analyze data on cost of living, economic development, and supply chain metrics to explore these dynamics:

1.1. How does the rising cost of living impact supply chain stability and costs?

1.2. What economic and regional factors contribute to cost increases within supply chains?

1.3. How can organizations adapt supply chain strategies to mitigate the effects of rising costs on consumers?

Teams will utilize a mix of economic, supply chain, and cost-of-living indices to develop insights and propose strategies that help businesses and policymakers maintain supply chain resilience in the face of economic pressures.

2. Business Objectives
The participant task is to build a data-driven model that examines the relationships between rising living costs, economic development, and supply chain performance. The end goal is to produce actionable insights that address the following questions:

2.1. Correlational Insights:
What patterns emerge between cost-of-living increases and supply chain disruptions?
Are certain regions or industries more susceptible?
2.2. Supply Chain Resilience Modelling:
Which economic indicators most strongly impact supply chain costs.
How can these insights guide predictions of supply chain challenges?
2.3. Strategic Recommendations:
What adaptations can businesses make to their supply chains to buffer against cost increases?
3. End Goal
Provide a set of recommendations for businesses and policymakers to help ensure that supply chains remain stable and cost-effective even as living costs and economic pressures rise.

4. Analytical Task
4.1. Data Analysis and Exploration:
Investigate the correlation between rising living costs and supply chain variables, identifying key regions or demographics most affected.

4.2. Predictive Modelling:
Create a model to forecast potential shifts in supply chain costs based on economic and living cost trends.

4.3. Insightful Recommendations:
Propose actionable strategies for businesses to adapt their supply chain management practices to withstand economic challenges.

5. Deliverables
5.1. Data Plan (included in the report):
Outline the methodology for merging and structuring data from multiple sources, identifying transformations for supply chain analysis.

5.2. Correlation Analysis and Predictive Model (include the details' in the report):
Detailed documentation of findings from the correlation analysis and model outputs, highlighting supply chain implications.

5.3. Presentation:
A business-oriented summary of insights, focusing on actionable supply chain recommendations designed for stakeholders and policymakers.

6. General Guidance
6.1. Project Feasibility and Scope:
Focus on key variables that best highlight the interplay between cost of living, economic factors, and supply chain stability.

6.2. Supply Chain Impact Insights:
Emphasize insights that are relevant for businesses aiming to make informed decisions about supply chain adaptations.

6.3. Modelling Approach:
Prioritize simple, interpretable models (e.g., regression analysis, time series forecasting) that effectively illustrate the relationships between economic factors and supply chain metrics.

Available Data & Suggested Indices​
Participants will use or be provided with the following datasets and indices:

Cost of Living Data
Consumer Price Index (CPI): Tracks changes in the price level of a market basket of consumer goods and services
Cost of Living Index: Includes various cost-of-living factors, such as rent, food prices, and average household costs by city and country.
Economic Development Indicators
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per Capita: Assesses the economic output per person in a region.
Human Development Index (HDI): A composite of life expectancy, education, and income, giving a broad view of development.
Gini Coefficient: Reflects income inequality, indicating economic disparity.
Unemployment Rate: Tracks economic stability and employment trends.
Supply Chain Metrics and Indices
Producer Price Index (PPI): Measures changes in selling prices received by domestic producers for their output, directly reflecting production costs.
Logistics Performance Index (LPI): Assesses a country’s logistics environment, crucial for understanding supply chain resilience.
Freight Rate Indices: Tracks shipping and transport costs, crucial as transportation is often impacted by cost-of-living changes.
Supply Chain Volatility Index: Measures fluctuations in supply chain stability, helping identify which sectors are most affected by rising costs.
Household Income and Expenditure Data
Average Household Income: Provides insight into purchasing power and disposable income, impacting demand and supply chain dynamics.
Household Expenditure Data: Helps identify consumer behavior changes in response to rising costs, which impact supply chain demand.
